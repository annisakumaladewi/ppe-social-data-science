# PPE with Social Data Science — Undergraduate Portfolio

This repository showcases my work from the **BSc Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) with Social Data Science** at University College London (UCL).  

It brings together projects that apply quantitative methods, causal inference, and data visualisation to questions in political and social research.

Each sub-repository corresponds to a core Social Data Science module and demonstrates both technical and conceptual skills developed throughout the degree.

## Overview

The Social Data Science pathway integrates political science with statistical and computational methods.  

Through these modules, I have developed practical expertise in **R programming**, **quantitative analysis**, and **causal research design**, alongside a critical understanding of how data informs policy and social outcomes.

## Modules and Projects

| Module | Description | Repository |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **POLS0010 — Data Analysis** | Introduces core principles of quantitative data analysis in political science. Students learn to collect, manage, and analyse data using statistical models in R, with an emphasis on reproducible workflows and clear presentation of results. ([Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/data-analysis-POLS0010)) | [View Repository](/pols0010-data-analysis) |
| **POLS0012 — Causal Analysis in Data Science** | Explores causal inference techniques including experimental and quasi-experimental designs, instrumental variables, and regression methods. Students apply these approaches to real and simulated data using R. ([Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/causal-analysis-in-data-science-POLS0012)) | [View Repository](/pols0012-causal-analysis) |
| **GEOG0162 — Cartography and Data Visualisation** | Focuses on the theory and practice of cartographic design and visual analytics. Students learn to communicate complex data effectively through maps, visual narratives, and data-driven graphics. ([Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/cartography-and-data-visualisation-GEOG0162)) | [View Repository](/geog0162-catography-data-viz) |
